I'm currently in the process of dusting off all my old github repos and turning them into a polished meaningful portfolio that represents my capabilities now with 5+ years of web development.
My existing projects are very much of "proof-of-concept" work and feel a lilttle dinky. But I have much better project management skills now, and a better eye for frontend design. It shouldn't be too difficult to take some old projects and make them look pleasant enough to showcase on my blog here.

Parameters. 
My goal is to spend no more than 1 week per project and to focus on pushing them over the finish line. The goal is explicitly not to rewrite the project in my current framework of choice. If I'm being honest, trying to rewrite is what killed half these projects, anyway.
