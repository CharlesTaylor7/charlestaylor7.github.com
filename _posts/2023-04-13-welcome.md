I'm currently in the process of dusting off all my old github repos and turning them into a portfolio that represents my growth over the last 5+ years of web development experience. 

My goal is to document and present each project, but not try to rewrite them in any capacity. This is part of me trying to accept what is, instead of giving into the the perfectionism that has kept me from sharing my work in the past. 

Looking back on my work, I've tried out lots of different frameworks in different languages and it should be fun to revisit them. Follow along if that interests you!
